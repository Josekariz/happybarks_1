 ## Description


Dogs are amazing! Their strength and ancestral instincts make them super helpful to us. They have been used since the early 1500s for hunting. These days most house dogs don't hunt for food because they have a reliable source which is you.


The majority of dogs are also left at home the whole day as the owners have to go to work to make ends meet. This state of leaving the dog at home or in a kennel is thought by many to improve the aggressiveness of the dog. There is some truth to this. If you were to be caged up you would lose your sense of humanity and probably go crazy. They are no different from us so dogs lose their friendly aspect over time when they are caged up and their primal instincts kick in.


This is a new century newer and better methods have been discovered to make the dog more aggressive without damaging its brain. Happybarks employs these techniques in dog training. At our facility, we ensure that all dogs receive adequate training based on their physical state. We also check through all the dogs to look for any diseases that affect dogs and treat them. By doing this we aid those who don't have enough time to care for their dogs due to work or other reasons and also anyone else who would like to better their dog's health.
